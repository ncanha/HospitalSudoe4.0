Script to perform the data treatment of IAQ data acquired using monitoring units based in low-cost sensors (1 year data)

These scripts perform a statistical analysis of the data acquired by real time monitoring units of IAQ (with a data frequency of 5 minutes). Moreover, correction factors are applied to each parameter, based in the outputs of an intercomparison study developed previous to the installation of the monitoring units.

The input data for each script (each script available is identifical only being different regarding the Monitoring Unit ID) is all the csv files provided by the monitoring units.

The output is csv files of statistics and figures for temporal variability (including all data, monthly and hourly) and correlation between parameters.

This work created by N. Canha and it was developed in the framework of Hospital Sudoe 4.0.
